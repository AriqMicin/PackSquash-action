# Purpose

The JSON manifests contained in this directory are to be served by routes at
https://binarymanifests.action.packsquash.aylas.org. When a new manifest version
is published, the routes must be updated by an authorized maintainer.

Please read the source code of the `PackSquashBinaryManifest` class for more
details.

# API stability guarantees

At the moment, these manifests are not meant to be consumed by third-party code
or applications. No technical measure will prevent you from doing otherwise, but
things may change here at any time without any announcement. Please contact us
if you are interested in stronger manifest API stability guarantees!
